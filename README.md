# Sustained transmission over two decades of a previously unrecognised MPT64 negative Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain in Queensland, Australia. 
This repository contains the XML files associated with the phylodynamic analyses performed in our manuscript (under peer review). 

These analyses were aimed at estimating the temporal evolution of both MPT64 negative and positive MTB strains (same lineage) and also estimate their epidemiological parameters, particularly effective reproductive number (R0) and non-infectious rate using birth-death skyline serial (BDS) in BEAST2. Relative transmission fitness was inferred using TransPhylo in R. All known MPT64 negative MTB isolates from Queensland and NSW, Australia were retrieved and whole genome sequenced. 

The raw sequencing data used in this study are available under project accession number PRJNA1095921.

    The listed XML files were some of the files used for phylodynamic analyses in BEAST2.
